#### Sheet1: 

Analysis of host effect on segment frequency in three datasets. Analysis of variance per segment (model: frequency ~ host) in three datasets (raw, corrected and Wo-10). Raw: raw copy numbers per segment and sample. Corrected: copy numbers after subtraction of copy numbers found in primer-independent amplifications. Wo-10: raw copy numbers for all segments but segment 10.

#### Sheet2: 

Analysis of host effect on segment frequency in three datasets. p-values of Tukey-HSD tests obtained from the analyses of variance in Table A4-A. Raw: raw copy numbers per segment and sample. Corrected: copy numbers after subtraction of copy numbers found in primer-independent amplifications. Wo-10: raw copy numbers for all segments but segment 10. Differences in significance levels were found between the Wo-10 dataset and the others for segment 9 (significant differences between ruminant and midge samples only found with Wo-10; p-value = 0.044).

#### Sheet3:

Primer couples discarded during the PCR validation.
